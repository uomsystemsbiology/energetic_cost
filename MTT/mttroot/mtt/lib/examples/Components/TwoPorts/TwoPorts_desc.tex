   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{TwoPorts} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:TwoPorts_abg.ps}; it contains the two
   port components: \textbf{TF} and \textbf{GY} in each of
   the two possible causalities.
   
   Note that the neither component has prefered causality and, in both
   cases, a causal stroke must be provided by the user. 
   
   Section \Ref{sec:TwoPorts_ode-noargs.tex} gives the system equations.
