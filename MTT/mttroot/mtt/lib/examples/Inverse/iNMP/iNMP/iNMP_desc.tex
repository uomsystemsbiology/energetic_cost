   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{iNMP} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{iNMP_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:iNMP_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:iNMP_sub}.

This is a simple non-minimum phase system with an inverse-type
response.  It is the standard fast negative and slow positive systems
in parallel. The corresponding inverse system \textbf{iiNMP} is
unstable.
